# giant-wiki

## Goals

- A more reactive documentation solution than writing and publishing markdown:
    - The publish workflow requires Github access.
    - The publish workflow is a slow cycle; friction causes edits to be deferred or lost.
- A more accessible documentation solution that a Github Wiki:
    - Github wikis are intimidating for non-technical users.
    - There are occasions when permission handling on Github has prevented us from sharing useful information in the wiki.

## Todo

- ~~Audit for old codebase mentions.~~
- ~~Adjust `core.home` to bounce to wiki index.~~
- ~~Page history, and browsing older versions.~~
- ~~Search.~~
- ~~`base_no_nav.html` might be redundant.~~
- ~~squash migrations~~
